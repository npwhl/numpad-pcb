I want a high-level overview of the project that a non-technical (like a hiring manager) person will understand.

Give a little background behind why the project interested you, if it's a personal project and not a required homework type thing.

Along with this, visuals are great if you have them. If it's a CLI app, show a few lines of output. If it's a GUI/webapp, give me some pics.

Known issues and bugs is great. You can include a to-do for unfinished features as well.

DETAILED instructions to clone/build/run. I shouldn't need to change lots of environment variables or paths you should have made relative but aren't.

Instructions to run tests.
